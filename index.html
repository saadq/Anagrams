    <h1>Anagrams</h1>
    <p>An anagram is a word formed from another by rearranging its letters. For example, "naimla" is an anagram of the word "animal".</p>
    <p> In this game, you must select the choice which is an anagram of the current word being displayed. You will have 5 seconds to choose, and your goal is to get as many correct as possible until you lose.</p>
